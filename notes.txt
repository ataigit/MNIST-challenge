Improvements ideas and todos:

    kNN: - do cross validation on validation data set but make sure
           that all of the training (i.e. train + val) data is in the distance matrix


    logreg: - try out different regularisation types, although I doubt that they will help much as the data is abundant
            - try out some more preprocessing like unit variance


    convnet: - find best FC network and add use it as model for the last FC layers.
             - initialise from the pretrained and train with some dropout and/or batchnorm layers


    gaussian: - read the book and implement it. Look for tutorials too.
