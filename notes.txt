Improvements ideas and TODOs:

    kNN:      - try out kNN after PCA with cross-validated dimension number

    convnet:  - try out different architectures and batchnorm

    gps:      - fix the multi-class case
              - implement hyperparameter optimisation

    dtrees:   - adapt the code to fit the structure defined so far
              - test and evaluate on the MNIST dataset (and cross-validate)

    others:   - add proper config.py using yaml
              - refactor the code and implement verbose prints for all models
