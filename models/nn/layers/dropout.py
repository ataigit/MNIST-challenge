    Performs the forward pass for (inverted) dropout.

    Inputs:
    - x: Input data, of any shape
    - dropout_param: A dictionary with the following keys:
      - p: Dropout parameter. We drop each neuron output with probability p.
      - mode: 'test' or 'train'. If the mode is train, then perform dropout;
        if the mode is test, then just return the input.
      - seed: Seed for the random number generator. Passing seed makes this
        function deterministic, which is needed for gradient checking but not in
        real networks.

    Outputs:
    - out: Array of the same shape as x.
    - cache: A tuple (dropout_param, mask). In training mode, mask is the dropout
      mask that was used to multiply the input; in test mode, mask is None.
