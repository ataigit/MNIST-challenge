## Description

The MNIST dataset is targeted by several machine learning models written from scratch.
The implemented algorithms so far are: vanilla kNN, logistic regression, convolutional neural networks and classification Gaussian processes. The code for the neural networks is  partly influenced by the Stanford CS231 assignments.

## Requirements
It is tested in Anaconda 2.7 environment. Mainly the external packages numpy, scipy and matplotlib are used, so an Anaconda installation is not really required.
 
## Run
see main.py

## Results:
accuracies on the test set:
* kNN: 97.05 % 
* LogReg: 92.61 %
* ConvNet: 99.03 %
* CGPs: 95.39 %
